I thought a little and decided this was a creative opportunity. Why not make it an accessory? A way to infuse some fun and sunshine into the day? Most everyone uses them at work! Let&#8217;s take every chance we can get to be cute, fashionable, or just plain fun. So I gathered a lot of different designs and a lot of boring badge reels, and got to work sprucing them up.

So the story is simple. The accessory is simple. But simple is good; simple can be shiny, simple can be flowery, simple can be colorful. Simply put, Badge Pizazz is the cherry on top of your day!

You can order any badge reel holder that is pictured or customized by sending us an [email](/contact)! You can also find these around the Greater Cincinnati area and local hospital gift shops, coffee shops and independent bookstores.
